Description: <br>

(The Quadrilateral class)
Design a class named Quadrilateral to represent a generic quadrilateral shape. The class should store details like the
lengths of four sides.

## Learning Outcomes
• Clarifying the concepts of classes, objects, methods and instance variables.<br>
• Declare a class and use it to create an object.<br>
• Declare methods in a class to implement the class’s behaviors.<br>
• Call an object’s method to make that method perform its task.<br>
• Accessing and changing the state of an object using (.) operator.<br>
• Creating overloaded constructors to ensure that an object’s data is initialized when the object is created
